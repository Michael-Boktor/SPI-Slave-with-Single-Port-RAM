# SPI Slave with Single Port RAM

![SPI Protocol](Images/SPI_Protocol.gif)

SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It enables a master device to communicate with one or more slave devices at high speeds using a minimal number of I/O pins. The protocol uses four main signals:
- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: Carries data from the master to the slave.
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: Carries data from the slave to the master.
- **SCLK (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission.
- **SS/CS (Slave Select/Chip Select)**: Used by the master to select which slave to communicate with.

## SPI Communication States

### 1. Write Address
1. Master starts the write command by sending the write address value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b00`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (write in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "00" and the next 8 bits being the write address.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "00".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the internal write address bus.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 2. Write Data
1. Master continues the write command by sending the write data value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b01`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (write in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 more bits, with the first 2 bits being "01" and the next 8 bits being the write data.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "01".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the RAM with the previously held write address.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 3. Read Address
1. Master starts the read command by sending the read address value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b10`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (read in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "10" and the next 8 bits being the read address.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "10".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the internal read address bus.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 4. Read Data
1. Master continues the read command by sending the read data command, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b11`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (read in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "11" and the next 8 bits being dummy data, which will be ignored as the master waits for data from the slave.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
6. RAM reads `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "11".
7. RAM reads from the memory with the previously held read address.
8. RAM asserts `tx_valid` to inform the slave that data output is ready.
9. Slave reads `tx_data` and converts it to serial output data on the `MISO` port.
10. `tx_valid` will be HIGH for 9 clock cycles (1+8).
11. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side after receiving data for 8 clock cycles.

## Getting Started

To work with this project, a Verilog simulator supporting the Spartan-6 architecture is required. **QuestaSim** is recommended for optimal simulation.

### 1. Simulating the Design (using the `.do` file)

A `SPI_do.do` file is included to streamline the simulation process.

- Ensure proper setup of your simulator and project environment.
- To execute the simulation:
  - Load the source files in the tool and use the console command: `do SPI_do.do`
  **OR**
  - Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `SPI_do.do`, and execute:
    - `source SPI_do.do` (Linux/macOS)
    - `SPI_do.do` (Windows)

  This script automates the compilation of Verilog files, runs the simulation using the testbench, and displays the waveform.

### 2. Manual Simulation (Optional)

You can also manually compile the source files and run the simulation through your simulator's interface if preferred.

### 3. Testbench Usage

- The testbench file (`tb_SPI_Wrapper.v`) includes example test cases for SPI operations.
- Modify the testbench to add more test vectors for thorough verification.

## Design Files

  - `SPI.v`: FSM Verilog module for the SPI
  - `ram.v`: RAM Verilog module for the SPI
  - `data.dat`: Used to initialize the RAM
  - `SPI_wrapper.v`: Verilog module combining `SPI.v` & `ram.v`
  - `tb_SPI_Wrapper.v`: Verilog testbench for simulation and verification.
  - `SPI_do.do`: Script for automating the simulation process.
